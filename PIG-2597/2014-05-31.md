Goal
---
 * ANTLR-based Grunt parser: by itself is not super-complicated
 * Use all commands in Macro, especially `REGISTER` and parameter substitution (https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/PIG-2597?focusedCommentId=13936422&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-13936422)
 

Macro
---

`REGISTER` command
---
`void processRegister(String jar)` in `class GruntParser` deals with it.
It is basically a frontend to `PigServer.registerJar(path)` or
`PigServer.registerCode(...)`


Development Environment Configuration
---
I forked apache/pig repo in github.com and cloned to `~/git/gsoc2014/pig` directory.
Then, I added `remote`. Please see "Fork a repo" (https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo) for the future reference.

```
kyunghoj@jeju:~/git/gsoc2014/pig$ git checkout -b trunk origin/trunk
Branch trunk set up to track remote branch trunk from origin.
Switched to a new branch 'trunk'
kyunghoj@jeju:~/git/gsoc2014/pig$ git branch
  branch-0.1
* trunk
kyunghoj@jeju:~/git/gsoc2014/pig$ git remote add upstream https://github.com/apache/pig.git

kyunghoj@jeju:~/git/gsoc2014/pig$ git merge upstream/trunk
```

Additionally, `javacc-4.2.jar` should be deleted from `.classpath` and `perf` 
should be excluded from `build.xml`. 

```

List of relevant pacackages and classes
---
 * `Grunt`
 * `GruntParser` <-- `PigScriptParser`
 * `DryRunGruntParser`
 * `org.apache.pig.parser.*` (ANTLR-based parser and its helper classes)

Memo
---
 * Rewrite PigScriptParser and merge with QueryParser?

 
TODO
---
 * Add one or two test codes and see if they work
