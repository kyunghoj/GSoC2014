`QueryParser.g` starts with the following definition:

```
query : statement* EOF -> ^( QUERY statement* )
;
```

`QUERY` seems like an imaginary token. 

Anyway, the output of the parser is `AST`, but it does not need to be the case
if it is a `Grunt` command.

However, what if a `Grunt` command is included in a macro?
